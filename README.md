# ClickTrends

This project was a part of my intership project, where I had redesigned the Click Trends company's website which is a sister company of Digital Expo and child company of Traffic Radius Pty. Ltd.

I had gone through all tradional development phases included while designing a website such as designing logo using Adobe Illustrator, wireframes, webpages in designing softwares such as Adobe Indesign, and finally developing website on Wordpress CMS Platform by creating a whole new theme from scratch.

Almost 90% of the website development was accomplished, remaining was left due to time constraint.
